# DS4002 - Case Study - Face Mask Detection Using Image Recognition

### Provided Documents

Read the provideed hook and rubric documents to understand the case study context and required deliverables. The hook document is in a file named [CS3 - Hook Document,](https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/CS3%20-%20Hook%20Document.pdf) and the rubric is named [Case Study Rubric](https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002_CS3/blob/main/Case%20Study%20Rubric.pdf). Adhere to the instructions outlined in these files for a successful case study. 

### Data

Check the [Materials/Data](https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002_CS3/tree/main/Materials/Data) directory for information on how to retrieve the image dataset from HuggingFace. Since the dataset contains almost is 12,000 rows of image data, it was too large to be uploaded into GitHub - check the instructions for accessing the dataset via the link provided. 

### Scripts

The [Materials/Code](https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002_CS3/tree/main/Materials/Code) directory contains the Python Jupyter notebook used during the project - use it as reference when reproducing the results. 

### Outputs

Check the [Materials/Outputs](https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002_CS3/tree/main/Materials/Output) directory for all plots generated during the project - use it as reference when reproducing the results.
